With green strokes into light and dark, there is a three-dimensional effect as if inviting the audience on a journey into the wild nature of Sulawesi.

        <div class="gallery-item" data-title="The Side of Kalimantan" data-description="The painting titled 'Sides of Kalimantan' carries the meaning that Kalimantan can create extraordinary beauty through its two distinct aspects. The first is through the culture they have inherited over generations, with a wide variety of differences. The second is through the economy and technology that continue to develop rapidly with the progression of time. These two aspects complement each other to create a more diverse, extraordinary, and beautiful harmony. This teaches us that culture and technology can create a better world if applied in balance.">
