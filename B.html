        <h1>Welcome to 9B's </h1>
       <h2>"Adventures of Indonesia"</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the fine arts exhibition presented by Class 9B with the theme "Adventure of Indonesia". This exhibition is the result of our students' hard work and creativity which aims to explore the beauty and diversity of Indonesian culture.
        </p>
        <p>“Adventure of Indonesia” invites visitors to explore various aspects of Indonesian life, from natural riches to unique traditions. Through works of art, we want to convey a message about the importance of preserving culture and the environment.
        </p>
        <p>This exhibition displays various works of art from Class 9B students. Each work is a personal expression that describes our experiences and views about Indonesia.
        </p>
        <p>We hope that this exhibition can provide inspiration and knowledge to visitors about the beauty and diversity of Indonesia.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting and supporting our work!</p>

        <div class="gallery-item" data-title="Acrylic Painting of the Latimojong Mountain" data-description="An adventure to enter deep into the tropical forest of Sulawesi, where various flora grow and have been living, like endemic plants and exotic trees. With green strokes into light and dark, there is a three-dimensional effect as if inviting the audience on a journey into the wild nature of Sulawesi. The details, like branches and shadows, can symbolize the balance of the ecosystem.

        <div class="gallery-item" data-title="The Side of Kalimantan" data-description="The painting titled 'Sides of Kalimantan' carries the meaning that Kalimantan can create extraordinary beauty through its two distinct aspects. The first is through the culture they have inherited over generations, with a wide variety of differences. The second is through the economy and technology that continue to develop rapidly with the progression of time. These two aspects complement each other to create a more diverse, extraordinary, and beautiful harmony. This teaches us that culture and technology can create a better world if applied in balance.">

In their rituals and ceremonies, these masks serve as a form of communication with the gods. A lot of the masks are also replicas of the gods' faces so that the god is truly never forgotten.">
