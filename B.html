It is located in the Papua province and is part of the Sudirman Range in the western half of New Guinea Island. This mountain is unique because it is one of the few places in the tropical region that has permanent glaciers, although they have been shrinking due to climate change. Mount Jaya Wijaya is also notable for its rugged terrain, steep cliffs, and limestone formations. It is a popular destination for climbers and adventurers due to its challenging routes and breathtaking landscapes. The mountain was first summited by an expedition led by Heinrich Harrer in 1962. It is also significant in terms of geology, as it was once part of an ancient seabed that was uplifted millions of years ago, making it rich in marine fossils.
