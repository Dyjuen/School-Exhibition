                <h3>Painting “The Sides Of Kalimantan”</h3>
                <p>The painting titled "Sides of Kalimantan" carries the meaning that Kalimantan can create extraordinary beauty through its two distinct aspects. The first is through the culture they have inherited over generations, with a wide variety of differences. The second is through the economy and technology that continue to develop rapidly with the progression of time. These two aspects complement each other to create a more diverse, extraordinary, and beautiful harmony. This teaches us that culture and technology can create a better world if applied in balance.

                <h3>Pop Art 3D “Kalimantan, The Lungs of Indonesia”</h3>
                <p>Pop Art 3D is an artwork made primarily from paper. We create a 3D effect by stacking layers of paper, making it thicker and giving it a sense of depth. The Paperclip artwork titled "Kalimantan, the Lungs of Indonesia" tells the story of Kalimantan's rich forests and trees, which serve as a vital source of oxygen for human life. </p>

        <h3>Mosaic Shell “The Map Of Kalimantan”</h3>
        <p>The mosaic titled “The Map of Kalimantan” shows that even though the mozaik is created from different materials, the materials work in harmony to create something unique. This represents our country as a whole. Even though we are different in the aspects of religion, race, culture, and many more, we can still work together to create something beautiful. This piece can also be a symbol of identity, preserving and celebrating the rich cultural heritage and natural beauty of the island of Kalimantan. </p>
