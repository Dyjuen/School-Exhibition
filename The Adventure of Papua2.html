                    <h3>Asmat Tribe Statue</h3>
                    <p>Asmat statues are one of the unique cultures of Papua. Every stroke of the statue has deep value. Asmat statues such as mbis statues not only have aesthetic values but are also able to connect them with the spirits of their ancestors. In addition to mbis statues, Asmat also has a statue of Asmat's heirs, which is usually more functional for family needs.
 
                        Asmat statues are usually made of wood, namely mangrove wood because the area where they live is surrounded by mangrove trees. For the Papuan people themselves, mangrove trees are interpreted as a source of life for the tribe. 
                        
                        So Asmat statues are not just ordinary
                         statues, but are art with various deep meanings.

                <h3>Jaya Wijaya Mountain </h3>
              
                <p>Mount Jaya Wijaya, also known as Puncak Jaya, is the highest mountain in Indonesia, standing at 4,884 meters (16,024 feet) above sea level. It is located in the Papua province and is part of the Sudirman Range in the western half of New Guinea Island.

                    This mountain is unique because it is one of the few places in the tropical region that has permanent glaciers, although they have been shrinking due to climate change. Mount Jaya Wijaya is also notable for its rugged terrain, steep cliffs, and limestone formations. It is a popular destination for climbers and adventurers due to its challenging routes and breathtaking landscapes.
                    
                    The mountain was first summited by an expedition led by Heinrich Harrer in 1962. It is also significant in terms of geology, as it was once part of an ancient seabed that was uplifted millions of years ago, making it rich in marine fossils.
